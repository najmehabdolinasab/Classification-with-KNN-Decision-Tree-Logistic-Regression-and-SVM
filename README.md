# Classification with KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM

This project demonstrates the use of multiple classification algorithms including KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict target variables. The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Project Description

In this project, the following steps are applied:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - Various libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**, and others are imported for data processing, visualization, and modeling.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Data is loaded and initial exploration is performed using methods like:
     - `head()` to display the first few rows of the dataset.
     - `info()` for basic data information, such as column types and non-null values.
     - Missing values are handled, and necessary data cleaning steps are performed.

3. **Splitting the Data**:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the models.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - **Decision Tree**: A Decision Tree model is trained and evaluated. A specific Decision Tree from the Random Forest is visualized.
   - **KNN**: The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is applied with varying values of `k` to evaluate its performance.
   - **SVM**: A Support Vector Machine model is trained using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for classification.
   - **Logistic Regression**: The Logistic Regression model is trained for binary classification.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - For each algorithm, the model is evaluated using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**. These metrics help assess the model's performance and accuracy.
